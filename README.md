# Lab 8 - Starter

1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

    I would fit the automated tests within a Github action in order to make sure the latest code doesn't break any unexpected functionality. We shouldn't worry about running them manually as the sole filter (although it would probably be encouraged before pushing code), and we certainly wouldn't wait until the very end of development to test the code.

2. No, it seems excessive since checking the output of a function won't require emulating user actions.
